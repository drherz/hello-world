# hello-world
Just another repository
I should know better, but sometimes I just can't be helped. I'm here because I have some great content I want to get on a webpage, and now I wanted to build a great web page, and I figured my knowledge of bootstrap is insufficient to my purpose, so I had to set up SASS, which meant - though I may have added more than I need - Visual Studio, node.js, ruby, and obviously github.
But now, I've got to get back to the content.
Have an Amazing Day!!
